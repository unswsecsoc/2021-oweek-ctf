## Idea
File extensions only matter to the program that is handling the file.

### Walkthrough
1. Opening the file with a text editor, the first three letters we see are 'PNG', followed by some information about Photoshop, and a garbled mess of random characters. It looks like this might actually be a PNG.
2. We can right click on the file and rename the file to end with .png (to do this, you may need to tick the option to 'show file extensions' in your file explorer.)
3. Open the file now! It should open as an image containing a flag.

### Flag
`OWEEK{aR3_fIL35_3V3n_rE4L??}`
