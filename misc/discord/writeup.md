## Description
Discord is amazing, especially with developer support, and an actually useful search tool. You should join the SecSoc Discord at [https://secso.cc/discord](https://secso.cc/discord)! I heard that abiramen#2452 posted an O-Week flag in plain sight, in an image back in April 2020! ðŸ¤¯

**Note:** You'll need to verify yourself on the SecSoc Discord to access the flag.
