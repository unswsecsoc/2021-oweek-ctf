## Description

I heard UNSW has a secret course that is raising black hat hackers. They have deleted any traces of it from their site, but we found a site that scrapes UNSW course information regularly: [notangles.csesoc.unsw.edu.au](https://notangles.csesoc.unsw.edu.au)

### Idea

There can always be someone who scrapes your site/github, be careful what you put on it

### Walkthrough

Part of the idea was to introduce first-years to notangles, which we hope can be useful to you for planning out your term timetable

1. When you get to the site, use the flavourtext hints, to search for "hacker", and you should see the FLAG1337 course
2. Select it, and it should reveal part of the flag
3. Move the other classes into place to get the rest of the flag

### Flag

`OWEEK{haL0s_h4vE_n0_aNgL3s}`
