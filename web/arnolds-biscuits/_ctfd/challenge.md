_(This challenge may require a basic understanding of the web to get -  however, don't let that put you off from trying!)_

Hi! I'm Arnold, founder of Arnold's Biscuits. At Arnold's, we aspire to manufacture high quality gift boxes for your loved ones so that you can give them biscuits to remember you by.

Recently, I hired some cheap freelance web developer online to design a website for me to communicate with my employees with. He made two accounts: one with username `employee` and password `biscuit123`, and another account for me to create the messages, with username `admin`. However, I don't really trust this freelancer's skills since they were so cheap. Could you test the website to make sure no one can get into my account?
