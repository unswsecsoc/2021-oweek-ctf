### Walkthrough
1. Enter any name that is not 'Alex'. In this solution, I will use Nicholas
2. You will see this as part of your URL: `?name=Nicholas&admin=false`. Change the name to Alex
3. You will end up with: `?name=Alex&admin=false`, but you will see that you also need to be an admin
4. Change admin status to true so it looks like `?name=Alex&admin=true`
