Hello! I'm part of the Student Integrity unit at Terribubble Universitee. At Terribubble, we take reports of academic misconduct very seriously.

Recently, we sent someone undercover in a private Discord server after reports of a student allegedly committing academic misconduct. Our undercover agent was able to take some screenshots of messages sent by this student. However, we have been unable to confirm their identity.

Would you be able to use these screenshots to investigate and find out who they are, so that we can deliver the appropriate disciplinary action? We'll also give you access to our student database to be able to confirm their identity (you'll need their ID number, and last name to check!). Thanks!

**Note:** Sometimes recon challenges require you to scour the internet.
