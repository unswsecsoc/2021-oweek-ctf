im lost i somehow found a comfy spot on Sydney Trains and fell asleep and missed my stop aaaaaa. the guard woke me up because we had reached the end of the train line, and im slightly dazed. i guess i could just take a train from the other platform to get home, but first im going to find a nice spot to nap. what station am i at?
