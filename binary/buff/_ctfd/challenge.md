_(Finding this challenge a bit daunting? That's okay! This is one of the more technical challenges in the CTF. [Annoyingly, it's at the top of the list, and we can't seem fix that...] Make sure to try some of the other challenges first!)_

So there were rumors SecSoc was starting a gym, I heard something about the directors wanting to become buffff.
I found a C program running on their servers which they want to use for their signups. Can you tell them it's a bad idea?

`nc pwn.unswsecurity.com 5001` or `telnet pwn.unswsecurity.com 5001`

(Don't know what the above line means? Make sure to try the 'üåêüò∏' challenge under the misc section first!)
