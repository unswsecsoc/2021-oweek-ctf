### Idea
Just another typical substitution cipher.

### Walkthrough

Substitution ciphers take a bit of trial and error to manually decode. However, a few things you can do are take a look at commonly occurring words. For example, two letters that tend to occur on their own are 'I' and 'A'. The most occurring two letter words are of, to, in, it, is, be, as, at, so, we, he, by, or, on, do, if, me, my, up, an, go, no, us, am. This list can help us out. You'll also need to use a bit of intuition, and take some brave guesses.
